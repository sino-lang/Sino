summary: A fast CSV command line toolkit written in Rust
description: |
  xsv is a command line program for indexing,
  slicing, analysing, splitting and joining CSV
  files. Commands should be simple, fast and
  composable:
  - Simple tasks should be easy.
  - Performance trade offs should be exposed
    in the CLI interface.
  - Composition should not come at the
    expense of performance.
